Purpose: This directory contains files that are used in the
two-part operation to extract and transform Playwrights CWRC
entry BIBCIT bibliographic XML blocks describing published
plays into individual MODS bibliographic record files.

Description: There are two principal phases in the processing
operation to transform CWRC entry BIBCIT XML blocks into MODS
records:

(1) Using an XProc pipeline file and an XSLT file to transform
and write out MODS collection files.  See the introductory
comments at the top of the "playwrights_published_plays2mods.xpl"
pipeline file for detailed instructions on how to carry out this
first phase of the operation.

(2) Using a batch file or a shell script, and an XSLT file, to
split and write out the MODS collection of bibliographic records
into individual MODS record files.  See the introductory comments
at the top of either the "playwrights_split_modsCollection.cmd"
batch file (used on Windows machines) or the
"playwrights_split_modsCollection.sh" shell script (used on
Unix-like machines) for detailed instructions on how to carry out
this second phase of the operation.

Manifest list of files in this directory:

* playwrights_published_plays2mods.xpl
    - XProc pipeline file that calls the
      "playwrights_published_plays2mods.xsl" XSLT file
* playwrights_published_plays2mods.xsl
    - XSLT stylesheet file that transforms BIBCIT blocks into
      MODS collection files
* playwrights_split_modsCollection.cmd
    - Batch file that calls the Saxon-HE processor JAR file
      "saxon9he.jar" and the XSLT stylesheet file
      "playwrights_split_modsCollection.xsl"
* playwrights_split_modsCollection.sh
    - Shell script that calls the Saxon-HE processor JAR file
      "saxon9he.jar" and the XSLT stylesheet file
      "playwrights_split_modsCollection.xsl"
* playwrights_split_modsCollection.xsl
    - XSLT stylesheet file that splits the MODS collection files
      into individual MODS record files
* README
    - This readme file that contains information about the files
      in this directory
* saxon9he.jar
    - Saxon-HE processor JAR file that is invoked by either the
      batch file "playwrights_split_modsCollection.cmd" or the
      shell script "playwrights_split_modsCollection.sh"
