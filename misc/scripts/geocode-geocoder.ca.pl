# Purpose: Perl script to geocode place names using the gecoder.ca API

# Description: Perl script to geocode place names into their associated coordinates of
# latitude and longitude using the geocoder.ca API.  The input file consists of a CSV
# text file with two fields, place name and 2-letter province/territory code, separated
# by a comma, e.g., "Edmonton,AB", with each line in the text file containing these two
# data elements.  The output data returned from the server is in XML format.  The resulting
# output file contains three comma-separated fields: place name and 2-letter province/territory
# code, latitude, and longitude.  To run the script, type the following at the command prompt:

#     perl geocode-geocoder.ca.pl input.csv > output.csv

# [This script adapted from a script located at this URL:
# http://geocoder.ca/?premium_api=1]

# Notes:
# * Geocode lookups using the geocoder.ca API can be done to a level of precision
# down to the street address -- the street address just needs to be added before the
# community name, separated by a comma.  For example, for Strathcona Public Library,
# it would be the following: 8331 104 Street,Edmonton,AB  Addresses with multiple parts
# can also be geocoded -- just add the multiple parts each separated by a comma, as in the
# following example: 4-20 Humanities Centre,University of Alberta,Edmonton,AB
# * Do not put a dash between the street address and the street name, as this will cause the
# query to fail.
# * The geocoder.ca API has a limit in the range of 500-2,000 lookups per day (varies
# according to server load).

# Useful documentation about the geocoder.ca API:
# * API: http://geocoder.ca/?premium_api=1
