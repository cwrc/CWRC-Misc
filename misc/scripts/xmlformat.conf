# MRB -- Fri 07-Mar-2014

# Purpose: Configuration file xmlformat.conf for the Perl program xmlformat.pl; defines
# how Orlando elements should be formatted

# Reference: xmlformat documentation can be found at 
# http://www.kitebird.com/software/xmlformat/xmlformat.html

# Notes:
# * xmlformat recognizes three types of elements: block elements, inline elements, and verbatim
# elements.  Several formatting properties can be controlled only for block elements, and thus
# inline elements are classed as "block" elements in the configuration file so that they can
# be styled appropriately.
# * There are basically two broad types of formatted elements:
#     (a) numbers 1, 2, and 3 below form one type, with the elements beginning on a new line,
# and for numbers 1 and 2, child elements beginning on a new line and indented four spaces; and
#     (b) numbers 4 and 5 below form another type, with the elements not beginning on a new
# line, and for number 4, any child elements do not begin on a new line and are not indented.
# * It is important that the normalize option value be set to "no" for each of the element
# categories.  The document is normalized earlier in the process, when the script
# xmlformat.sh normalizes and joins the document content by trimming trailing and leading
# whitespaces (normalize), and then replaces end-of-line characters with a single blank
# space (join).  By setting the normalize value to "no", the code in the program xmlformat.pl
# can then appropriately process the text and whitespace nodes.
# * Useful xmlformat configuration-related commands:
# - To see the list of xmlformat command line options:
#     perl xmlformat.pl --help
# - To see the configuration file option directives (i.e., this file's configuration options):
#     perl xmlformat.pl --show-config
# - To see elements that are in a document but that have not been defined in the configuration
#   file options:
#     perl xmlformat.pl file_name --show-unconfigured-elements --config-file xmlformat.conf
#   and to loop through files in a directory:
#     for f in *; do perl xmlformat.pl "$f" --show-unconfigured-elements --config-file xmlformat.conf; done
