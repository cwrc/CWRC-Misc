GeoNames processing instructions

* Download the desired GeoNames data from the GeoNames Web site.
Web site is located at http://www.geonames.org/
* Select a subset of the downloaded data file if desired, e.g.,
Canadian populated places (CA country, and PPL* feature class) and
administrative boundaries (CA country, and ADM* feature class).  Can
use Windows findstr command or Unix grep command to select and output
the filtered subset.
* Use search-replace.awk or search-replace.pl to convert various GeoNames
codes to their English-language equivalents.  This script was run six
times to convert six different codes.
* Use csv2xml.awk or csv2xml.pl to transform the tab-delimited file into
a generic XML file.
* Use geonames2place.xslt to transform the generic XML file into a CWRC
place entity XML file.
* Use split_place_entities.xslt to split the CWRC place entity XML file
into individual CWRC place entity records.
